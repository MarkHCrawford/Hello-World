  <head> Hello Everyone </head>
    <body> 
      I am Mark Crawford, and I am new to programming, but am ethusiastic to begin learning and, hopefully, eventually master it. <br>
      I may be new, but I am a quick learner. I intend to master web development, java, and python, implementing these skills in a variety of ways in a competitive workplace.
